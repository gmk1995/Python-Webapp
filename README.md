# Python-Webapp
This is a basic example of a web application, it creates a Flask application instance and defines two routes: / and /sum. The first route, /, is associated with the hello_world function, which simply returns the string "Hello, World!" when the route is accessed. The second route, /sum, is associated with the sum function, which expects a JSON payload with two properties, num1 and num2, it's then adding those two numbers and returning the result. This route is only accessible via the HTTP POST method.
The last line, app.run(debug=True), starts the development web server. This allows you to test your application by visiting http://localhost:5000/ in your web browser. You can also test the /sum endpoint by sending a post request to http://localhost:5000/sum with a JSON payload.
